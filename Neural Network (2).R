#linout stands for linear out-put and is used to determine whether the target variable is continuous or not
#size sets the number of units in hidden layer
#decay is the regularization parameter. You can use any value between between zero and one
#maxit denotes the maximum number of iterations taken by the algorithm that computes the weights

#Neural network model out put
summary(nn) #Summary gives you the number units in each layer in addition to all the weights


#To plot the neural network using nnet we need to use devtools
